# file-backup-app
This is a software created with tkinter to back up folders in any directory multiple times without much work.


I usually need to back up my files in mutlitple directories, with one of them being the main source. 
Everytime I make major update in the main directory, I have to copy the fileand paste it. Sometimes, this may also go wrong.


For this I created a software that allows one to create projects. To create one, you need to give it a name, the folder to be backed up and its destination. The project will be created and saved.

I can now anytime go and click the project and select back up Button. This will allow my software to back up the source in it's destination automatically.
